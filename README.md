Implementation of a portable Red Black Tree library. 
The project consists of three directories: 
  SRC, RBTreeLib and RBTreeImpl.
The SRC directory contains the red black tree implementation in C. The main header is RBTree.h.
The RBTreeLib is a static library intended to be linked against by who ever wants to use the RBTRee code.
The RBTreeImpl is a C++17 wrapper around the RBTree intended to use C++ best practices. This project is still work in progress.
